# Connect your own data

The starter runs against bundled sample data. This is how you replace it.

Everything you need to change lives under `src/data/`. The routes, the request
and response validation, and the OpenAPI document are all derived from the
schemas — they do not need to know where the data came from.

---

## 1. Implement the repository interface

`src/data/repository.ts` defines the seam:

```ts
export interface OpportunityRepository {
  list(pagination: Pagination): Promise<Page<Opportunity>>;
  get(id: string): Promise<Opportunity | null>;
  search(
    filters: OpportunityFilters,
    sorting: SortSpec,
    pagination: Pagination
  ): Promise<Page<Opportunity>>;
}
```

Three things are worth knowing before you write your implementation:

- **Nothing HTTP-shaped crosses this boundary.** No envelopes, no status
  codes, no framework context. Return domain objects and a total count; the
  route layer builds the response.
- **`pagination` is already normalized.** `page` and `pageSize` are positive
  integers by the time they reach you — the route layer applied the protocol's
  defaults and flattened its nullable types.
- **`sorting` is already resolved.** `sortBy` is a key you can execute and
  `sortOrder` is `"asc"` or `"desc"`. Implementation-defined sort keys never
  reach you; the route layer falls back to the default order and reports that
  in `sortInfo.errors`.

`src/data/fixtures.ts` is the reference implementation. Read it before you
write yours — it shows what real filtering, sorting and paging have to handle,
including the parts that are easy to get wrong (see §4 and §5).

Then wire it up in `src/index.ts`:

```diff
-import { fixtureRepository } from "./data/fixtures.js";
+import { postgresRepository } from "./data/postgres.js";

-const app = createApp({ repository: fixtureRepository });
+const app = createApp({ repository: postgresRepository });
```

Delete `src/data/fixtures.ts` and `src/data/opportunities.json` once nothing
imports them, and drop the `cp` of the JSON file from the `build` script in
`package.json`.

## 2. Map your ids onto stable UUIDs

`Opportunity.id` is a UUID, and it is the public identity of the record: it
appears in `GET /common-grants/opportunities/{oppId}`, so consumers will store
it, bookmark it and use it as a foreign key.

**The same source record must always produce the same UUID.** If your system
uses integer or string keys, do not generate a random UUID per request or per
import. Either:

- store a generated UUID alongside each record the first time you see it, and
  read it back afterwards, or
- derive one deterministically from your key — a UUIDv5 over a namespace you
  own is the usual choice.

Keep the original key too. `customFields` is a good home for it (see §6), and
it is what lets you trace a CommonGrants id back to your own system.

## 3. Return parsed values, not raw rows

Your repository returns `Opportunity`, which is
`z.output<typeof OpportunitySchema>` — the _parsed_ type. Date fields are real
`Date` objects, not strings.

The simplest correct implementation parses your rows through the schema:

```ts
import { OpportunitySchema } from "./schema.js";

const rows = await db.query(/* ... */);
const items = rows.map(row => OpportunitySchema.parse(toCommonGrants(row)));
```

If a row cannot be parsed you find out at the source, with a Zod issue path
pointing at the field. If you skip this step and hand back a hand-built object,
the route layer's response validation catches it instead and answers `500` —
correct, but much harder to debug.

## 4. Date-valued fields in filters and sorts

Two date shapes appear in the protocol and they behave differently:

| Field                                     | Schema              | Serializes as              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `createdAt`, `lastModifiedAt`             | `UTCDateTimeSchema` | `2026-02-12T14:30:00.000Z` |
| `keyDates.*.date`, `startDate`, `endDate` | `ISODateSchema`     | `2026-03-31`               |

`ISODateSchema` produces a `Date` subclass whose `toJSON()` emits the date-only
form. **Copying that value turns it back into an ordinary `Date`** —
`structuredClone(d)` and `new Date(d)` both lose the date-only serialization and
start emitting a full timestamp on the wire. Pass the parsed value through
untouched, or re-parse with `ISODateSchema` after transforming.

A shallow spread such as `{ ...opp }` is safe: it copies the reference to the
same `Date` instance rather than cloning it. It is deep copies and explicit
reconstruction that lose the behavior.

For sorting and range filters, compare the underlying instants
(`date.getTime()`), not the strings. `closeDateRange` values arrive as ISO
strings and both ends of a `between` range are inclusive.

## 5. Money is a decimal string

`Money.amount` is a `string`, not a number, so that no precision is lost in
transit. Comparing those strings directly gives you lexical order:
`"9000.00" > "10000.00"`. Convert before you compare or sort — see
`moneyAmount()` in `src/data/fixtures.ts`, or push the comparison into SQL with
a numeric cast.

The same applies to `funding.estimatedAwardCount` and friends, which _are_
numbers — mixing the two is the easy mistake.

## 6. Add custom fields in one file

`src/data/schema.ts` is the single definition of the opportunity model. The
response factories, the repository's types and the OpenAPI document all read
from it, so extending it extends all of them at once.

It does not change this template's request schemas: the list, get and search
requests carry pagination, filters, sorting and an id, none of which embed the
opportunity model. Custom fields reach the wire through opportunity **response**
data, its types, and its OpenAPI definitions.

```ts
import { OpportunityBaseSchema } from "@common-grants/sdk/schemas";
import { withCustomFields } from "@common-grants/sdk/extensions";
import { z } from "zod";

const LegacyIdValueSchema = z.object({
  system: z.string(),
  id: z.number().int(),
});

export const OpportunitySchema = withCustomFields(OpportunityBaseSchema, {
  legacyId: {
    fieldType: "object",
    value: LegacyIdValueSchema,
    description: "Maps to the opportunity_id in the legacy system",
  },
  category: {
    fieldType: "string",
    description: "Grant category",
  },
} as const);

export type Opportunity = z.output<typeof OpportunitySchema>;
```

That is the whole change. Afterwards:

- `opp.customFields?.legacyId?.value.id` is typed `number`, with no cast.
- A custom field of the wrong type is rejected at parse time, with the issue
  path pointing into `customFields`.
- The custom fields appear in the opportunity response definitions in
  `/openapi.json` with their real value schemas.
- Routes, handlers and the repository interface are untouched.

Keep `as const` on the specs object — without it the literal `fieldType` values
widen to `string` and the typed inference is lost.

### One caveat: `.openapi()` on SDK schemas

`@common-grants/sdk` publishes CommonJS. In this ESM project that means the
SDK's schemas are built by Zod's CommonJS copy, while `@hono/zod-openapi`
attaches its `.openapi()` helper to Zod's ESM copy. Composing, parsing and
OpenAPI generation all work across that boundary — but calling `.openapi()`
_directly on a schema imported from the SDK_ compiles and then throws at
runtime.

Build the schema locally when you need `.openapi()`:

```ts
// Throws at runtime:
UuidSchema.openapi({ example: "..." });

// Works — same validation, built from this project's zod:
z.uuid().openapi({ example: "..." });
```

### And one more: import from the subpaths

In `@common-grants/sdk@0.7.2` the package's root export is broken — its
`exports["."]` points at `dist/index.js`, but the published tarball only
contains `dist/src/index.js`, so a bare import fails to resolve:

```ts
// Cannot find module:
import { OpportunityBaseSchema } from "@common-grants/sdk";

// Works:
import { OpportunityBaseSchema } from "@common-grants/sdk/schemas";
import { withCustomFields } from "@common-grants/sdk/extensions";
```

The subpath exports (`/schemas`, `/extensions`, `/types`, `/constants`,
`/client`) all resolve correctly, and this template only uses those. Import
from them and you will not hit it.

## 7. Tests

The four suites divide along the seam:

| Suite                        | Keep or replace                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test/app.test.ts`           | **Keep.** Health, OpenAPI, 404 and error shaping — no fixture data involved.                    |
| `test/opportunities.test.ts` | **Keep.** Drives the routes with stub repositories, so it never mentions a fixture id or count. |
| `test/openapi.test.ts`       | **Keep**, and extend the operation list if you add routes.                                      |
| `test/fixtures.test.ts`      | **Replace.** Every assertion is about the bundled sample data.                                  |

Write the replacement for your repository against the same checklist the
fixture suite covers, because these are the cases that break in production:

- an empty page past the end, and the total staying correct
- both ends of a `between` range, inclusive
- records with **no value** for a filtered or sorted field
- ties on the sort key — pick a deterministic tie-break and test it, otherwise
  paging can show or skip a record
- money compared numerically rather than lexically
- both sort directions, including on date-valued keys

Then add at least one integration test that runs your real repository against a
real (test) data store. The route tests prove the contract; only an integration
test proves your mapping.

## 8. Keeping up to date

Two different things, often confused:

**Your dependencies.** Your project's problem, on your schedule. The
`@common-grants/sdk` releases are the ones to watch, because they carry
protocol changes: <https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-protocol/releases>.
The template ships a Dependabot configuration that separates SDK updates from
everything else — keep that separation, it makes the protocol-relevant PR easy
to spot.

**The template itself.** A project created from a GitHub template has no
ongoing link to its source. There is no automatic synchronization, no
backports, and no obligation on the template's maintainers toward your
application. If you want a later improvement, look at the template's commit
history and cherry-pick it deliberately:
<https://github.com/common-grants/cg-api-template-hono/commits/main>.

## 9. Before you ship

- Replace `.github/CODEOWNERS`, the issue templates and the pull-request
  template with your own — the ones you inherited point at this template's
  maintainers.
- Update `name`, `description` and `license` in `package.json`, and the
  `info` block in `src/app.ts` that titles your OpenAPI document.
- Re-read [docs/known-spec-discrepancies.md](docs/known-spec-discrepancies.md)
  and re-run `pnpm check:spec` against your own document.
