# CommonGrants API template — Hono

A working [CommonGrants](https://commongrants.org) API you can run in about a
minute, then point at your own data.

It starts as a complete, self-contained service: three opportunity endpoints
backed by bundled sample data, every request and response validated with the
published [`@common-grants/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@common-grants/sdk)
schemas, and an OpenAPI 3.1 document generated from those same schemas at
`/openapi.json`. Nothing is stubbed out and nothing is left as an exercise —
connecting your own data is one interface with three methods.

Built with [Hono](https://hono.dev) and
[`@hono/zod-openapi`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** — use whichever installation or version manager you prefer.
  The included [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) is available for `nvm` users. Its bundled
  `npm` is the only package manager you need.

No project-specific global packages, credentials, database or infrastructure
are required.

## Get started

Click **Use this template** at the top of
[this repository](https://github.com/common-grants/cg-api-template-hono) to
create your own, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your-api>.git
cd <your-api>
node --version # must report v24.x
npm ci
```

Check that everything works before you change anything:

```bash
npm run ci
```

That runs the static checks, the build, and the test suite with coverage.

Hosted CI runs that same command, then `npm run audit`.

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
# A page of opportunities, most recently modified first
curl 'http://localhost:3000/common-grants/opportunities?pageSize=2'

# Filtered and sorted search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/common-grants/opportunities/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"filters":{"status":{"operator":"in","value":["open"]}},"sorting":{"sortBy":"title"}}'

# The OpenAPI 3.1 document, generated from the same schemas
curl http://localhost:3000/openapi.json
```

## Connect your own data

The bundled sample data lives behind a three-method interface. Implement that
interface against your database or upstream API and the routes, validation and
OpenAPI document all keep working unchanged.

**→ [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) is the walkthrough.** It covers replacing the
repository, mapping your ids onto stable UUIDs, handling date-valued fields in
filters and sorts, adding custom fields in one file, and which tests to keep.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                                   | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/common-grants/opportunities`         | Paginated list, most recent `lastModifiedAt` first |
| `GET`  | `/common-grants/opportunities/{oppId}` | One opportunity by id                              |
| `POST` | `/common-grants/opportunities/search`  | Filtered, sorted, paginated search                 |
| `GET`  | `/health`                              | Liveness check                                     |
| `GET`  | `/openapi.json`                        | The OpenAPI 3.1 document                           |

Every response — including errors — validates against a schema from
`@common-grants/sdk`. Requests that do not match their schema get a `400` in
the protocol's error shape; an unknown but well-formed id gets a `404` in the
protocol's not-found shape.

## Commands

| Command                           | What it does                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                     | Start the server with reload on change                          |
| `npm run build`                   | Compile to `dist/`                                              |
| `npm start`                       | Run the compiled server                                         |
| `npm test`                        | Run the test suite                                              |
| `npm run test:coverage`           | Run the tests with a coverage report                            |
| `npm run checks`                  | Lint, format check and typecheck (never writes files)           |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run format` | Apply lint and formatting fixes                                 |
| `npm run export:openapi`          | Write the served document to `dist/openapi.json`                |
| `npm run audit`                   | The required dependency audit                                   |
| `npm run audit:report`            | Every severity, not just high                                   |
| `npm run ci`                      | The static/build/test suite: `checks`, `build`, `test:coverage` |

`npm run audit` is deliberately separate from `npm run ci` and runs immediately
after it in hosted CI.

## Maintenance

Projects created from this template are **independent**. There is no automatic
synchronization, no backports, and no source-maintainer responsibility for
derivative applications. You own your copy, including its dependency updates
and its `.github/` metadata — replace the issue templates and
contribution links with your own.

This template itself is maintained by Bryan, Kari and Laura. Dependency updates
are reviewed deliberately rather than generated automatically. Review SDK
updates separately because they can carry protocol changes; nothing is
auto-merged.

For how to keep your own copy current — and why updating your dependencies and
adopting template changes are two different jobs — see
[Keeping up to date](PORTING.md#8-keeping-up-to-date).

## Scope

This template is a starting point, not a framework. It deliberately ships
without a docs UI, deployment or auth recipes, a project generator, a live
database example, or release machinery. Add what your service needs.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## License

[CC0 1.0 Universal](LICENSE). Dependencies keep their own licenses.
