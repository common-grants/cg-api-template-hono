# CommonGrants API template — Hono

A working [CommonGrants](https://commongrants.org) API you can run in about a
minute, then point at your own data.

It starts as a complete, self-contained service: three opportunity endpoints
backed by bundled sample data, every request and response validated with the
published [`@common-grants/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@common-grants/sdk)
schemas, and an OpenAPI 3.1 document generated from those same schemas at
`/openapi.json`. Nothing is stubbed out and nothing is left as an exercise —
connecting your own data is one interface with three methods.

Built with [Hono](https://hono.dev) and
[`@hono/zod-openapi`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** — the runtime. Use whichever installation or version manager
  you prefer; the included [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) is available for `nvm` users.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3 or newer** — the package manager and script
  runner only; the floor is declared in `engines.bun`. Bun installs
  dependencies and runs the scripts below; your server still runs on Node.

No project-specific global packages, credentials, database or infrastructure
are required.

## Get started

Click **Use this template** at the top of
[this repository](https://github.com/common-grants/cg-api-template-hono) to
create your own, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your-api>.git
cd <your-api>
node --version # must report v24.x
bun --version
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Check that everything works before you change anything:

```bash
bun run ci
```

That runs the static checks, the build, and the test suite with coverage.

Hosted CI runs that same command, then `bun run audit`.

Start the server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
# A page of opportunities, most recently modified first
curl 'http://localhost:3000/common-grants/opportunities?pageSize=2'

# Filtered and sorted search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/common-grants/opportunities/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"filters":{"status":{"operator":"in","value":["open"]}},"sorting":{"sortBy":"title"}}'

# The OpenAPI 3.1 document, generated from the same schemas
curl http://localhost:3000/openapi.json
```

## Connect your own data

The bundled sample data lives behind a three-method interface. Implement that
interface against your database or upstream API and the routes, validation and
OpenAPI document all keep working unchanged.

**→ [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) is the walkthrough.** It covers replacing the
repository, mapping your ids onto stable UUIDs, handling date-valued fields in
filters and sorts, adding custom fields in one file, and which tests to keep.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                                   | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/common-grants/opportunities`         | Paginated list, most recent `lastModifiedAt` first |
| `GET`  | `/common-grants/opportunities/{oppId}` | One opportunity by id                              |
| `POST` | `/common-grants/opportunities/search`  | Filtered, sorted, paginated search                 |
| `GET`  | `/health`                              | Liveness check                                     |
| `GET`  | `/openapi.json`                        | The OpenAPI 3.1 document                           |

Every response — including errors — validates against a schema from
`@common-grants/sdk`. Requests that do not match their schema get a `400` in
the protocol's error shape; an unknown but well-formed id gets a `404` in the
protocol's not-found shape.

## Commands

| Command                           | What it does                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`                     | Start the server with reload on change                          |
| `bun run build`                   | Compile to `dist/`                                              |
| `bun run start`                   | Run the compiled server on Node                                 |
| `bun run test`                    | Run the test suite                                              |
| `bun run test:coverage`           | Run the tests with a coverage report                            |
| `bun run checks`                  | Lint, format check and typecheck (never writes files)           |
| `bun run lint` / `bun run format` | Apply lint and formatting fixes                                 |
| `bun run audit`                   | The required dependency audit                                   |
| `bun run audit:report`            | Every severity, not just high                                   |
| `bun run ci`                      | The static/build/test suite: `checks`, `build`, `test:coverage` |

`bun run audit` is deliberately separate from `bun run ci` and runs immediately
after it in hosted CI.

Bun runs the scripts; the scripts run Node. `bun run start` is `node
dist/index.js`, and the tests, the build and the dev server all execute under
Node 24 — swapping in Bun as an application runtime is not supported. Note the
`run`: bare `bun test` runs Bun's own test runner on Bun's runtime instead of
Vitest on Node, so it does not tell you the code works where it will ship.

## Structure

```
src/
  index.ts               Node entrypoint — the only file that knows about Node

  routes/
    opportunities.ts     Route definitions, handlers, request/response validation
  data/
    schema.ts            The one opportunity schema — extend custom fields here
    repository.ts        The data seam: list / get / search
    fixtures.ts          Reference implementation over the bundled sample data
    opportunities.json   The bundled sample data
test/                    Vitest suites: fixtures, app, routes, OpenAPI

## Maintenance

Projects created from this template are **independent**. There is no automatic
synchronization, no backports, and no source-maintainer responsibility for
derivative applications. You own your copy, including its dependency updates
and its `.github/` metadata — replace the issue templates and
contribution links with your own.

For how to keep your own copy current — and why updating your dependencies and
adopting template changes are two different jobs — see
[Keeping up to date](PORTING.md#8-keeping-up-to-date).

## Scope

This template is a starting point, not a framework. It deliberately ships
without a docs UI, deployment or auth recipes, a project generator, a live
database example, or release machinery. Add what your service needs.
